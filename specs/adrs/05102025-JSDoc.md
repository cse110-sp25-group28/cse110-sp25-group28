# Adopt JSDoc for Documentation of JavaScript Code

## Context and Problem Statement

We want our JavaScript project to have consistent documentation. Lack of documentation makes it harder to maintain and read the codebase, and understand the purpose of individual functions and modules. We need a standardized and lightweight way to document our functions, types, and classes inline within the codebase. This ensures that everyone is on the same page in terms of documentation to make it easier to read, understand, and modify code as a team.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for developer-friendly, in-editor documentation support (e.g., VSCode)
* Want to avoid maintaining separate documentation files
* Improve code readability
* Encourage consistent commenting practices
* Maintain consistent code structure and syntax

## Considered Options

* Use JSDoc
* Use external Markdown documentation
* Do not document at all / rely on code clarity

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Use JSDoc"**, because it allows inline, standardized documentation that can be used by IDEs, reduces documentation overhead, and improves team collaboration without the need for separate doc files.

### Consequences

* Good, because we improve documentation quality without much overhead
* Good, because tools like VSCode can show function signatures and types
* Good, because JSDoc is widely adopted and integrates with ESLint plugins
* Bad, because some developers may need to learn JSDoc syntax initially

### Confirmation

This decision will be confirmed by:
* Requiring JSDoc-style comments for all public functions and modules
* Code reviews checking for appropriate documentation
* Optionally using `jsdoc` to generate HTML docs to test compliance

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use JSDoc

* Good, because documentation lives close to the code
* Good, because it helps IDEs provide better suggestions
* Good, because it’s widely adopted and has tooling support
* Neutral, because it requires developers to follow a new format
* Bad, because learning curve for proper annotation may exist

### Use external Markdown documentation

* Good, because it allows highly customized docs
* Neutral, because documentation is not tied directly to functions
* Bad, because it's easy to let it fall out of sync with code
* Bad, because it increases overhead to maintain separate files
* Bad, because it can be daunting to track every (necessary) function in seperate markdown

### Do not document

* Good, because no time spent writing docs
* Bad, because it reduces maintainability
* Bad, because understanding unfamiliar code takes longer
* Bad, can decrease bus factor
## More Information

* [JSDoc homepage](https://jsdoc.app/)
* [JSDoc syntax cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/jsdoc)
* We’ve already installed JSDoc via npm: `npm install --save-dev jsdoc`
* Future improvements may include generating HTML documentation with `npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json`
