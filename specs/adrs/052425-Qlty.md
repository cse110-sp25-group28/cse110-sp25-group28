# Qlty for Automated Code Quality Management

## Context and Problem Statement

Our group wanted a way to ensure code quality without manually parsing issues and commits for discrepancies, a method that could lead to inconsistency, increased maintenance time, and slow code reviews. We needed an automated solution that supported our project, integrated well with our designated workflow, and provided actionable feedback directly within pull requests.

## Decision Drivers

* Reduces tool fragmentation and maintenance by providing numerous code quality tools.
* Support specific to the the programming languages we are utilizing.
* Automated, actionable feedback on code quality and code maintainability in pull requests.
* Easy integration with CI/CD pipeline and developer workflows.
* Open source, extensible tooling with strong community and vendor support.

## Considered Options

* Qlty (formerly Code Climate Quality)
* SonarQube/SonarCloud
* GitHub Advanced Security

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Qlty, because it offered a unified, cloud-based platform with broad language support, open source CLI, and integration with GitHub pull requests and our CI/CD pipeline. Qlty reduces tool fragmentation and accelerates code review by providing actionable, automated feedback.

### Consequences

* Good, because it simplifies our code quality workflow, consolidates multiple tools, and provides consistent and automated feedback for our project.
* Good, because it provides support for the languages we use and integrates well with our existing CI/CD and GitHub workflows.
* Bad, because there may be an initial learning curve for the team.
* Bad, because some advanced features require a paid subscription.

### Confirmation

Implementation will be confirmed through:
* Successful integration of Qlty CLI into our CI/CD pipelines.
* Ensure automated PR feedback and quality enforcement on new pull requests.
* Periodic code reviews and dashboard checks to ensure code quality metrics are improving.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### SonarQube/SonarCloud

* Good, because it is a long time, feature-rich platform with strong support.
* Good, because it provides thorough dashboards and tracking across versions.
* Bad, because it requires additional server setup or a subscription.
* Bad, because language support is less flexible than Qlty.
* Bad, because integration with pull requests and developer workflows may require more configuration.

### GitHub Advanced Security

* Good, because it is well integrated with GitHub which our project is hosted on.
* Good, because it provides code scanning and secret detection.
* Bad, because it is limited to GitHub repositories and may not support all languages.
* Bad, because it can be expensive for organizations.

## More Information

* The team reached consensus on this decision after different options suggested by the course and professor were discussed in the Slack group.
* Decision will be revisited if any major issues arise.
