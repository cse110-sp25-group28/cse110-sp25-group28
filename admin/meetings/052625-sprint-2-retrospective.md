## Retrospective

### What went well

- Overall: we accomplished a majority of what we planned and did so while constantly communicating with each other
- Frontend/Design: Open communication between group members, good flow of ideas and foundational themes
- First JavaScript team meeting
- Workflow: Using GitHub Projects and using more communication channels in Slack definitely helped with streamlining our efforts

### What didnâ€™t go as well

- Frontend/Design: Late start on tasks set us back; scheduling/timing conflict and other issues made it difficult to work with other members
- How we can do better: Schedule meeting times earlier to avoid time conflicts (for this week, we have already begun setting up meeting times in person to make progress together and to hold accountability)
- Start earlier and smaller so continuous contributions can be made (make commits more often to keep rest of group updated)

### Features:

- Not clear on how exactly we wanted to move forward in terms of what is defined as done and what is needed next
- Running into some trouble on implementation of card card flipping (Need to discuss when we want the cards to be flipped, how to shrink the cards back if they are flipped when enlarged)

### Tests:

- Not done, some were made but with how features were being implemented and changing even on the last day making/keeping tests relevant to what was being implemented was an issue
