## Review

### Physical Accomplishments:

- The main page with all the cards
- Getting the workout card data with images, categories, and stuff
- CI/CD Pipeline works - just need end to end testing now
- Delegating people into different tasks
- Figma link for our rough wireframes: https://www.figma.com/design/uiBCd2VlNt0DIKE2GLmyeL/Untitled?node-id=390-2&t=Nry0f0FsXVdVl8SB-1

### Next Goals:

- Main page to display all the user’s decks
- Secondary page (what we have rn) will list all of the possible cards for users to build new decks from
- We need to build main page and navigation between the two pages
- Also need to integrate localStorage to keep track of user decks
- Later on: make a third page for when a user clicks on a deck to view that deck’s cards
- When viewing cards, we need the backs to just have the muscle group. (chest, back, quads, hamstrings, shoulder, biceps, triceps, abs, glutes)
- For the CI/CD people: work on end to end testing in addition to unit tests
- Javascript: filtering/categorizing, selection button to create new deck, view decks page
