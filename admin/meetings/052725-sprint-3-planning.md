- Animation and styling for the face down card
- Creating a deck (Daniel, Nikitha, Ulzii)

- View deck page (Jeremy, Roger)Ability to view a deck in the collection and flip through the cards and shuffle them

### Frontend:

- Polish website design for main + deck page (maintain cohesive branding)
- Implement options for light and dark mode
- Create logo for website, as well as icons for different features/card groups
- Flesh out design and structure of individual cards (based on muscle group?)
- Figure out how to style different filtering options/dropdowns

### General:

- Set up more issues and tasks within the GitHub projects tab
- Delegate tasks clearly to avoid uncertainty and time loss
