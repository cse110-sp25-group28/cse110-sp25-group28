### Next Goals:

- Main page to display all the user’s decks
- Secondary page (what we have rn) will list all of the possible cards for users to build new decks from
- We need to build main page and navigation between the two pages
- Also need to integrate localStorage to keep track of user decks
- Later on: make a third page for when a user clicks on a deck to view that deck’s cards
- When viewing cards, we need the backs to just have the muscle group. (chest, back, quads, hamstrings, shoulder, biceps, triceps, abs, glutes)
- For the CI/CD people: work on end to end testing in addition to unit tests
- Javascript: filtering/categorizing, selection button to create new deck, view decks page

### Coding Style

- Variables and functions: camelCase (totalCount, calculateSum)
- Classes: PascalCase (UserAccount)
- Constants: UPPER_CASE_SNAKE (MAX_SIZE)
- Files and Folders: kebab-case(user-folder.js)
- Indentation and formatting (2 or 4 spaces)
- Max line length of 80 characters
- Consistent use of whitespace around operators, after commas, and inside parentheses/brackets
- Allman style block structure
