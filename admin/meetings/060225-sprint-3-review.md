## Goals from last meeting:

### Features:

- Card flipping feature for create-deck (Aidan, Sam)
- Cards are all face down until clicked upon (backside labeled with muscle category)
- See the category first
- When flipped, let's see exercise Sets and reps, maybe????
- Animation and styling for the face down card
- Creating a deck (Daniel, Nikitha, Ulzii)
- Clicking create deck with selected cards adds a new deck to main page in local storage
- View deck page 
- Ability to view a deck in the collection and flip through the cards and shuffle them

### Frontend:

- Polish website design for main + deck page (maintain cohesive branding)
- Implement options for light and dark mode
- Create logo for website, as well as icons for different features/card groups
- Flesh out design and structure of individual cards (based on muscle group?)
- Figure out how to style different filtering options/dropdowns

### Test: (Ethan, Jeffrey, and every js person should look too)

- Shuffling (implemented but not shown on website just test js)
- Filtering (more tests)
- Create-deck.js (more tests?)
- Flipping Cards (not yet implemented but will need tests soon)

### General:

- Set up more issues and tasks within the GitHub projects tab
- Delegate tasks clearly to avoid uncertainty and time loss
- Create a dev branch to push before main
- Organize config files in one folder
- Be more thorough when reviewing prs to check that they do what is intended and add a comment too

## Progress Updates:

### Frontend:

- Implemented further design for main page (index.html)
- Also implemented light and dark mode (currently on a branch)
- Created logo for website which was added to the header
- Styled different filtering options/dropdowns for muscle groups on deck creation page

- Features: 
- Implemented Create Deck feature fully functional with edge cases
- Implemented View Deck Page with flipping and moving through cards

### Tests: 

- More e2e tests and unit tests for all the new features and interactions with localStorage
- Cover most aspects of our code now

### What we missed:

- Better documentation for files
- Shuffling feature
- View-deck page aesthetics
